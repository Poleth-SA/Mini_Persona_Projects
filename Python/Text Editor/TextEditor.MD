# Simple Text Editor Explanation

## What the Program Does

1. Creates a window with a text area where you can type and edit text.
2. Provides a menu with options to create a new file, open an existing file, save the current file, and quit the program.

## Main Components

### 1. Import Statements
```python
from Tkinter import *
from tkFileDialog import *
```
These lines import the necessary tools to create the graphical interface and handle file operations.

### 2. File Operations
The code defines several functions to handle file operations:

- `newFile()`: Clears the text area to start a new file.
- `saveFile()`: Saves the current text to a file.
- `saveAs()`: Allows you to save the current text to a new file.
- `openFile()`: Opens an existing file and displays its content in the text area.

### 3. Creating the Window
```python
root = Tk()
root.title("Text Editor")
root.minsize(width=400, height=400)
root.maxsize(width=400, height=400)
```
These lines create the main window for the text editor and set its size.

### 4. Text Area
```python
text = Text(root, width=400, height=400)
text.pack()
```
This creates the main text area where you can type and edit text.

### 5. Menu Bar
The code creates a menu bar with a "File" menu, which includes options for:
- New
- Open
- Save
- Save As
- Quit

### 6. Running the Program
```python
root.mainloop()
```
This line starts the text editor and keeps it running until you close it.

## How to Use

1. Run the Python script.
2. A window will open with a blank text area.
3. Use the "File" menu to create new files, open existing ones, or save your work.
4. Type and edit text in the main area.
5. Close the window or use "Quit" from the menu to exit the program.

This text editor provides basic functionality for creating, editing, and saving text files with a simple graphical interface.
